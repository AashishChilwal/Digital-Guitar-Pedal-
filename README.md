# Digital-Guitar-Pedal-

## Project Description:

Guitar pedals are used to modify  (i.e., filter) the sound and frequencies of an electric or acoustic guitar. They are 
typically located on the ground, hence the name 'guitar pedal'. The signal is picked up by either a microphone of an 
electromagnetic pickup, then put through the guitar pedal(s), and then into the amplifier/speaker. <br><br>

These guitar pedals can be analog or digital. Digital guitar pedals can be designed using MATLAB and digital signal 
processing filters. 
<br><br>
There are several common guitar pedals:  
     list item1 i. Tuning pedal: Communicates how close to known pitches the guitar strings are tuned, i.e., it can discern 
          if a string is tuned sharp (pitch too high frequency) or flat (pitch too low frequency) 
     list item2 ii. Delay pedal: Creates echo effect by repeating signal in time-domain 
     list item3 iii. Distortion pedal: Uses feedback to create a coarser sound 
     list item4 iv. Compression pedal: This pedal compresses the volume (i.e., amplitude) of different pitches, i.e., making 
          low volumes pitches higher volume and making high volume pitches a lower volume. This evens out the 
          sound (with all amplitudes being close to equal) and is a popular effect for the guitar as many strings are 
          played at once. 
 
In  this project, MATLAB is used to  design  the  digital  signal  processing  filters  for  a 
digital guitar compressor pedal.
